				<h3 class = "plot-desc">The Fellowship is Formed</h3>
        <p class = "plot-txt"> The story of The Lord of the Rings begins in the Shire, a peaceful land inhabited by hobbits. Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, inherits a powerful and dangerous artifact called the One Ring from his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. The Ring was created by the dark lord Sauron, who seeks to use it to control all of Middle-earth. Knowing the danger that the Ring poses, Gandalf the wizard sends Frodo on a mission to destroy the Ring by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally forged.
          Frodo sets out on his journey with his loyal friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They soon encounter many dangers and challenges, including the treacherous weather, the dangerous wilderness, and the menacing Nazgul, who are the servants of Sauron. To aid Frodo on his quest, a fellowship is formed, consisting of Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir the man, and Aragorn, a ranger who is later revealed to be the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor.</p>

        <h3 class = "plot-desc">The Mines of Moria</h3>
        <p class = "plot-txt">As the fellowship travels through Middle-earth, they face many challenges, including an attack by the Uruk-hai, a breed of powerful orcs. The group decides to take a shortcut through the Mines of Moria, but they soon find themselves under attack by a powerful Balrog, a fiery demon. Gandalf sacrifices himself to save the rest of the fellowship, and the group is forced to continue their journey without him.
          The loss of Gandalf was a significant blow to the fellowship, as he was not only a powerful wizard but also a trusted friend and guide. His death also served as a reminder that the journey ahead would not be easy, and that the stakes were higher than ever.</p>

				<h3 class = "plot-desc">The Siege of Helm's Deep</h3>
        <p class = "plot-txt">Meanwhile, Saruman, a once-respected wizard, has turned to the dark side and is working with Sauron to conquer Middle-earth. He sends an army of orcs to attack the fortress of Helm's Deep, where the people of Rohan are seeking refuge. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive in time to aid in the defense of the fortress, and they are joined by the wizard Gandalf, who has returned from the dead as Gandalf the White.
          The battle of Helm's Deep was a pivotal moment in the story, as it showcased the strength and courage of the characters. The fellowship was no longer a small group of friends traveling together; they had become warriors fighting for the greater good of Middle-earth. The battle also marked the beginning of a new chapter in the story, as the fellowship was reunited with a more powerful and experienced Gandalf.</p>

        <p class = "plot-txt">As the fellowship nears the end of their journey, Frodo and Sam leave the group to continue their quest to destroy the Ring. They are aided by the strange creature Gollum, who has a complicated relationship with the Ring. The group encounters many dangers, including the spider-like creature Shelob, who almost kills Frodo.
          Meanwhile, the rest of the fellowship to fight against Sauron's forces in the final battle of the War of the Ring, the Battle of Pelennor Fields. The battle was fought in the city of Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. The armies of Rohan and Gondor, led by Aragorn, Eowyn, and Faramir, united against Sauron's forces, which included the Nazgul and the fearsome Mumakil, giant elephants ridden by orcs.
          The battle was brutal and intense, with many casualties on both sides. It was during this battle that the hobbit, Merry, showed his bravery by aiding Eowyn in slaying the leader of the Nazgul. The victory at Pelennor Fields marked a turning point in the war, and gave Frodo and Sam the opportunity to continue their quest to destroy the Ring.

        <p class = "plot-txt">Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mount Doom, where they plan to destroy the Ring. However, Gollum, who has been leading them to the mountain, betrays them and takes the Ring for himself. In the ensuing struggle, Gollum falls into the fires of Mount Doom, destroying the Ring and ultimately defeating Sauron.
          The destruction of the Ring was a momentous event, as it not only ended the war but also freed Middle-earth from the threat of Sauron's power. The characters who survived the war, including the hobbits and their friends, returned to their respective homes, forever changed by their experiences.</p>

				<h3 class = "plot-desc">The Unexpected Jounrey</h3>
        <p class = "plot-txt">The Hobbit follows the journey of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who is content with his simple life in the Shire. However, everything changes when he is recruited by the wizard Gandalf to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug.
          The first chapter, "The Unexpected Party," sets the stage for the adventure to come. Bilbo is hesitant to join the dwarves, as he is not one for adventure, but Gandalf insists that he will be a valuable member of the group. The dwarves arrive at Bilbo's home for a dinner party, which turns into chaos as they begin discussing their quest. Bilbo eventually agrees to join them, and the group sets off on their journey.</p>

				<h3 class = "plot-desc">Roast Mutton</h3>
        <p class = "plot-txt">In Chapter 2, the group encounters some setbacks as they make their way through the countryside. They are attacked by trolls who capture the dwarves and threaten to eat them. Bilbo manages to save the day by using his wits to distract the trolls, allowing the others to escape.
          As the group continues on their journey, they stumble upon a group of Wargs and are forced to seek refuge in a nearby tree. It is during this time that Bilbo discovers a magical ring, which will later prove to be a valuable tool in his quest. The group is eventually rescued by the wizard Gandalf and the Lord of the Eagles, who help them continue on their journey.</p>

				<h3 class = "plot-desc">A Short Rest</h3>
        <p class = "plot-txt">The group finally arrives at the Lonely Mountain, where they plan to confront Smaug and reclaim their treasure. However, before they can do so, they must first find a way to enter the mountain. Bilbo volunteers to go in and scout it out, using his ring to remain invisible.
          Inside the mountain, Bilbo comes face to face with Smaug, who is guarding the treasure. Bilbo manages to outwit the dragon and steal a valuable gem, which angers Smaug and prompts him to attack the nearby town of Lake-town. Bilbo and the dwarves must then rally the town's people to defend themselves against Smaug's attack.  
          Chapter 3, "A Short Rest," is a pivotal chapter in the story, as it sets the stage for the final confrontation with Smaug. It also highlights Bilbo's bravery and resourcefulness, as he continues to prove himself to be a valuable member of the group.</p>
